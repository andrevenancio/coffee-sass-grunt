## CoffeeScript + Sass + Grunt
I've wrote this tutorial as a learning process when I forced myself to learn CoffeeScript. Since [CoffeeToaster](https://github.com/serpentem/coffee-toaster) was discontinued, I decided to go with [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/). I tried to keep this as simple as possible. :grin:
There is no logic in the code inside the `.coffee` and `.sass` files as they are filled with random stuff just for the purpose of compiling "something".


### Getting Started
If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins.

### Install all dependencies in your package.json
```shell
npm install 
```

### Run local Gruntfile
```shell
grunt
```
